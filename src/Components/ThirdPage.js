            In February 2014, Bishop kumalo motivated the roman Curia Congregation for the causes of the Saints 
            on behalf of the Diocese of Eshowe
        </li><br></br>
        <li>
            The Diocese of Eshowe mainly considred three aspects of the life of Sr Reinolda May as motivation for
             the cause of her sainthood, namely, Fame of sactity,Heroicity of virtue, and Appropriateness of the 
             Cause of her Sainthood for the Curch in Southern Africa
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
            In motivating for the Cause of Sainthood of Sr Reinolda May OSB, the Diocese of Eshowe encountered 
            difficulties securing readily available persons with expertise in theoolgy, canon law or church history
             to lead process of the Beatification (Postulator)-Hence the gap between 2014 and 2017
        </li>
