        <p className=' text-xs md:px-20 px-3'>
        In 1926, the Benedictines opened a mission station in Nongoma, and established other out-stations in the 
        district to win new converts. In 1944, they bought a 338-hectare farm at Ngome as a source of income for 
        the Nongoma mission station with its school and hospital. The farm was mainly used for cattle but a small 
        school, Mayime, was also erected to enable basic education for local children. The classroom was also used 
        as a chapel for Sunday Holy Mass.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a missionary worker, Sr Reinolda longed to bring the love of Christ to God's people in Zululand. On many 
        Sundays, she went with the Nongoma out-stations' priest, inviting people to Mass, cared for the sick and 
        dying and also counsel marriages. She won the hearts of many by her kindness and generous readiness to help. `Mashiyane', as she was fondly called, because of 
        her thick eyebrows, was well known and loved in the region. Even the Zulu King, Zwelithini, who was born in her 
        department, often came to her small office they shared knowledge and counsel.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        She helped the poor, distributed food and clothing and did not stop even when her kindness was occasionally 
        misused. The pastor of Nongoma, described Sr Reinolda as a very solid missionary nun in the truest sense of 
        the word and of inestimable help to his pastoral work. Her friendly manner combined with her zeal for souls 
        had a great moral influence on those who sought her help, many non-practicing Catholics found their way back 
        to the Church.

        <br></br>
        She tracked down children who received emergency baptisms in her maternity department and encouraged parents 
        to enroll baptized children in Catholic schools. Through her nursing and pastoral visits, she could direct 
        missionaries to families in need of pastoral experience.

        <p className=' text-xs md:pl-2 md:pr-28 md:pt-1 px-3'>
        Bishop Thomas Spreiter of Eshowe, strongly believed in the importance of indirect mission work in schools 
        and hospitals as means to spread the faith. He had ceaselessly, for many years, sought permission from Rome 
        to train Benedictine Nuns in midwifery, and finally receiving permission in 1936, also from Tutzing.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In spite of own concerns about her age (mid-thirties), lack of secondary education and limited knowledge of 
        the English language, Sr Reinolda responded positively to her Superior's request to train as a midwife. 
        Trusting in God's help and the requisite to meet the personnel demands of the hospital, under construction 
        at the time, she studied hard and received a midwifery diploma from Greys Hospital in Pietermaritzburg in 
        May 1938.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In June 1938 the Nongoma Benedictine Mission Hospital opened and the newly qualified Sr Reinolda, 
        first nun trained in midwifery, was placed in charge of the maternity division.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The early years were difficult there was great poverty and distrust from the community. Sr Reinolda prayed 
        hard, in the hospital's chapel, for fortitude to handle the difficulties.She also trained many midwives; 
        her first group took exams in 1941. Her expertise as a midwife earned her the trust of other medical 
        practitioners and attracted expectant mothers from afar.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Sr Reinolda remained head of the Benedictine Hospital Maternity Division until her retirement in June 1976; 
        the South African government took over the hospital in the same year. Statistics indicate over 28000 children 
        were born during the 38years the maternity division was under her tutelage and management.
